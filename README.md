# Ultra Marathon Data Analysis Project

## Overview:

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of ultra marathon race data sourced from Kaggle, encompassing over 7 million race records from 1798 to 2022. The goal is to analyze trends in race performance, athlete demographics, and the impact of race conditions on finishing times.

## Key Features:

- Data Acquisition: Downloaded and extracted a comprehensive dataset of ultra marathon races. The CSV file used in this project can be found within the Python file itself.

- Data Cleaning: Utilized Python and Pandas to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering for specific race categories (50k and 50 miles) in the USA for the year 2020.

- Data Transformation: Created new columns for athlete age and categorized race seasons based on event dates.

- Data Visualization: Employed Seaborn to generate various visualizations, including histograms, violin plots, and scatter plots, to illustrate performance trends and differences by gender and age.

- Group Analysis: Conducted group-by operations to analyze average speeds and performance metrics across different demographics and race conditions.

## Technologies Used:

- Python 
- Pandas 
- Seaborn 
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion:

This project showcases the importance of data cleaning and analysis in drawing meaningful insights from large datasets. It highlights how race conditions and athlete demographics influence ultra marathon performance.

## Feel free to explore the code and visualizations to gain insights into the fascinating world of ultra marathons!
